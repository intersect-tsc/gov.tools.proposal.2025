# Comparison with IOE Budget Proposal

The TSC anticipates that IOE would be the supplier of many necessary work items.

## Maintenance

The TSC proposal is calculated on 40% of the 58 core FTEs that have been identified as part of the core team \- the 40% is the number quoted by IOE engineers as being necessary for maintenance, plus contingency to cover Daedalus etc. It is not clear how the IOE proposal is calculated, but it appears to cover 49 FTEs.  

It is not completely clear what items the IOE proposal would cover under the maintenance heading, but apparent omissions from the IOE proposal include:

* Daedalus (covered by another budget proposal)  
* Hardware wallets (partially covered, but not entirely, by another budget proposal)  
* Cardano-node emulator (covered by Tweag/ModusCreate)  
* GraphQL/cardano-wallet (if needed, currently covered by the Cardano Foundation)  
* DB-Synthesizer etc (needed for e.g. disaster recovery)  
* Support for other core Intersect-maintained repositories  
* Mempool monitoring  
* Mithril  
* DB-Sync  
* Support for Technical Working Groups etc

The TSC regards all of these as essential services that need to be maintained. 

While the IOE proposal covers L1/L2 support for the network (monitoring and response), IOE has reduced its capacity here, so may be unable to fulfil this role.  This may be better provided by e.g. SPOs or other community members.  IOE also proposes to take on network monitoring.  This work is currently undertaken by the Cardano Foundation.  Likewise disaster recovery will necessarily involve core developers, but also needs to involve SPOs and the community at large, and full coordination.

## Core Operational Costs

The TSC proposal explicitly separates out necessary infrastructure operational costs at rates that have been previously quoted by IOE.  Attention will be paid to reducing these costs via e.g. the use of alternative cloud providers.  The IOE costs are not broken down and are $1.5M rather than the $404,000 that the TSC has calculated as essential costs.

## Core Infrastructure Roadmap

The IOE proposal does not give specific goals for work items or milestone deliverables, and does not indicate efforts allocated to each work item (estimates can be back-calculated from the $299,000/FTE which the proposal assumes.  The TSC proposal is more systematic in defining required outcomes via specific SRLs, the development of which will have precisely defined milestone deliverables, and in providing estimates of FTEs (from which cost estimates can be more precisely calculated).  It is more concrete in a number of areas, e.g. Leios, Nested Transactions, Hydra, Mithril, and expects more community engagement in defining technical goals and requirements.  It also allows for the possibility of failure, e.g. where a work item does not meet needs.

The IOE proposal charges exactly the same rate per FTE ($299,000/FTE).  It also assumes a “time-and-materials” basis.  The TSC proposal uses the same FTE rate as a budget estimate, but actual costs may be variable, with surplus returned to the treasury.

The TSC proposal is not completely prescriptive on the work items to be covered, but leaves it open to fill the roadmap within the available budget, driven by community needs/requirements/priority setting.

#### Items that are covered in the TSC proposal but not in the IOE proposal are:

* Ouroboros Peras \- seen as a high priority by the community \- this is covered by a separate proposal from Tweag/ModusCreate  
* Midgard \- seen as a high priority by the community \- this is covered by a separate proposal by Anastassia Labs  
* Anti-Grinding \- early stage (so low SRL and relatively low cost, but very applied), creates a back-stop for finality, complements Peras  
* Timeliness Market \- a low-cost activity that enables dApps to have certainty over timing of transactions via SPO engagement  
* Governance improvements \- these are important to evolve  
* Support for alternative node implementations \- survey results indicated this to be a high priority to the community \- no specific proposal was submitted to the TSC for support for e.g. Amaru

#### Items that are covered in the IOE proposal but not in the TSC proposal include:

* Tiered pricing \- there is limited community support for this (and some negative sentiment). While the TSC understands the desire for assurance transactions being on-chain within a given time interval, in a decentralized system where pricing decisions need to be made by consensus (and hence take time) the effectiveness of pricing is limited. The TSC has concerns that the proposal is over optimistic as presented. It should be noted that there is another approach that may fulfill the need based around “timeliness market” as mentioned above.  
* Automatic Formal Verification, Property Based Testing, Static Analyzer, Transaction Monitoring System \- community survey results showed no positive support for this work as part of the core roadmap and some significantly negative support \- the TSC opinion is that such work is currently best seen as tooling activity which could potentially be covered by the OSC remit  
* Plutus Core Roadmap \- this was not submitted by IOE to the TSC for consideration, but is aligned with the Product Committee roadmap.  It could be included in a revised TSC budget.   
* Minotaur AVS \- this was not submitted by IOE to the TSC for consideration, but is potentially aligned with the Product Committee roadmap.  It could be included in a revised TSC budget. The first stage of core development would need to be a technical feasibility study.  
* KES agent \- this was not submitted by IOE to the TSC for consideration.  Work is almost complete; initial development has been funded by Intersect. The completion could be included in a revised TSC budget if there is sufficient community support.  
* A new node (Acropolis) \- this is potentially aligned with the Product Committee roadmap.  However, there are many competing alternative node implementations. These should be evaluated by the community on merit.

## TSC and Community Support

The TSC proposal explicitly includes a sufficient budget to support the TSC and the community as part of Intersect.  These include technical town halls, workshops/open days, a technical communication officer and other provisions that are designed to ensure good technical communication.

## Progress Reporting, Milestone Review, Project Changes

The TSC proposal explicitly includes provisions for progress reporting, technical review for all milestones, redeployment of effort in line with changing community needs/requirements or technical concerns such as unexpected security issues.  In combination with technical communication offers these will support transparency.

## Risk and Contingency

The TSC proposal explicitly covers risk and contingency. An explicit budget line of approximately 10% has been set aside for contingencies that can cover e.g. unexpected development issues, security concerns etc. as outlined in the proposal.
