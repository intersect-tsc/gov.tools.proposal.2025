# Overlap with other Core Proposals

## Midgard

Overlaps. Anastassia Labs.  The Midgard proposal can be absorbed into the TSC one.

## Daedalus Maintenance

Overlaps.  Community Proposal. This proposal can be absorbed into the TSC one.

## Hardware Wallets Maintenance

Overlaps. Vacuumlabs. This proposal can be absorbed into the TSC one.

## Tweag Proposal

Contains several work items.  Two of these overlap.

Peras: Generally overlaps. The Tweag proposal doesnâ€™t include provision for full integration/rollout (it will be necessary to create a new ledger era and include this here), or for the necessary work on the networking layer to support voting.  Work on Alpha Peras may be needed if the research advances sufficiently.  Milestone reviews are also needed.

Cardano Node Emulator Maintenance.  Overlaps and can be absorbed into the TSC proposal.

Other items do not overlap, but look like sensible items to include in a budget provided sufficient effort is available.
