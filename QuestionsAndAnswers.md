# TSC Budget Proposal: Questions & Explanations

## Questions

### Why is this budget not broken down into line items?

There are two reasons. The first reason is that one major concern for the TSC in preparation of this budget was ensuring the continuity of expertise and skills related to development of the core node. Losing key contributors is often the death knell for many open source projects, and we wish to avoid this.

Most of these contributors work full-time on Cardano on both maintenance and feature development. Most likely they would not be available to work, say, only 30-40% on maintenance \- they would move to other projects. Securing the resources allows flexibility to alter the feature development priorities in the current year without threatening core maintenance activities.

The second reason is that such a breakdown would be necessarily fictitious. Without going through a process of competitive tender, the TSC does not have detailed cost breakdowns for each item. Such competitive tender will progress steadily throughout the year as projects become viable.

### Why not perform tendering directly on-chain?

An alternative to “paying for people”, as this proposal puts forward, would be for suppliers to directly submit proposals on-chain. This would have a number of disadvantages:

1. Proposals are not independent. Work affecting the core node (or future alternative nodes should they become widely used) must be coordinated in order to ensure that:  
   1. Any combination of proposed items is coherent \- for example, two proposals making changes to the reward calculation may not, if both carried out, lead to a function that makes any sense.  
   2. Any combination of proposed items can be worked on simultaneously \- e.g. it would make little sense to work on two items which require modifying the same sections of code, since they are likely to clash.  
   3. Any combination of proposed items is compatible and does not violate any chain security or performance requirements.  
2. Technical work must be integrated. This requires coordination with maintainers, testers and potentially other people working on similar areas. There are likely to be costs associated with such integration that must be considered as part of any proposal.  
3. Any work affecting consensus or ledger rules requires a hard fork and must therefore be coordinated with SPOs, providers of downstream tools etc.   
4. In order to ensure sufficient work to employ people, suppliers might be tempted to propose more work than they have the capacity for, in case some proposals are unsuccessful.

#### How will the TSC ensure nobody is getting paid twice?

The TSC will propose to issue one or more maintenance/retainership contracts, whose purpose is to ensure the retention of those experts currently maintaining the core node infrastructure. Such contracts will name specific individuals and their roles, and require that suppliers inform us if said individuals leave or are replaced by others.

Any supplier bidding for a feature-based contract will be required to name the individuals working on that contract and to zero-rate any work carried out by individuals named in the retainership contracts. Suppliers and Intersect shall routinely publish reports of how much time for people employed on retainership contracts is spent on maintenance vs feature development.

### How does this proposal support competitive tender?

The TSC aims not only to retain existing experience but to grow the number of people contributing to core Cardano development. As such this proposal requests additional ADA beyond the retainership contract to support bringing new developers into the system.

When evaluating value for money, the TSC will compare costs including the value of any people zero-rated due to their being named in a retainership contract \- that is, costs will be compared assuming those people had been charged at full rate.

### What is the TSC’s approach to reconciliation, changes and improvements to this proposal?

#### While the TSC feels strongly that the principles of probity, order, honesty, security, sustainability, longevity and a proper respect for the governance process are essential to ensure sustainable core infrastructure development and maintenance, this proposal is presented to the community as a vehicle for constructive discussion.

#### The TSC recognizes the need for feedback and the continued inclusion of thoughts, suggestions and sentiment towards core development from all parts of the ecosystem. The TSC openly admits that it does not have all the answers. However this initial proposal serves as a reference point for an open, ongoing conversation. The TSC welcomes feedback through the reconciliation process and wider ecosystem collaboration, and is open to suggestions and changes to any part of the proposal as currently suggested. 

### What is the TSC’s position on Competing/Overlapping Proposals

Following proper technical evaluation, the TSC is open to overseeing other core infrastructure work that the community wishes to progress under the same conditions that it is proposing.  Such work must be technically feasible, compatible with other core infrastructure work, have a proper plan for integration and rollout, meet all necessary security and other audit requirements, be aligned with the agreed community roadmap, and not be exploitative.  Proposed budgets may need to be adjusted to account for overlaps.
